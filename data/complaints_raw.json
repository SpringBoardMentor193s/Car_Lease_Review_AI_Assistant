          "complaint_what_happened": "I first contacted SANTANDER CONSUMER USA on XX/XX/XXXX regarding the insurance check I received from my insurance company, XXXX XXXX. The check is intended to repair my vehicle, which sustained hail damage during a recent storm in Colorado. \n\nPer their instructions, I mailed the check to the provided address, which I confirmed online, on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon calling them on XX/XX/XXXX, they confirmed receipt of the check. I requested Santander to endorse and return the check to me ; however, they informed me of a policy requiring checks over {$5000.00} to be sent directly to the repair shop. The representative advised me to email them at XXXX with my car 's VIN as the subject and include the repair shop details. I complied with these instructions, noted down during the call, and emailed them on XX/XX/XXXX, copying the repair shop and requesting the repair shop to provide Santander with any further needed information ; I also provided my phone number for direct contact. \n\nDespite this, they neither sent the check nor contacted me or the repair shop until I reached out on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. After an hour on hold, they claimed the check was not visible in their system. I insisted it was received, as confirmed by other representatives. Following another 30-minute hold, they acknowledged possession of the check but required verbal confirmation from the repair shop. I contacted the repair shop, and they called and confirmed the repair on my car, and it is ready for pick up. \n\nEven after the repair shop confirmed, Santander failed to send the check, requiring additional follow-up. Despite numerous calls from the repair shop and enduring hour-long waits, Santander continued to claim they were waiting for information from the repair shop, showing a lack of transparency. Additionally, I sent around 5-6 emails to Santander informing them that I had reached the maximum coverage from my insurance company for my rental and that I am now paying for the rental out of my own pocket. \nAt this point, I'm uncertain about how to proceed to secure their endorsement on the check. Since Thursday, I've been covering the rental car expenses myself. The process they've outlined is ambiguous, we've submitted everything they require, yet their communication is non-existent. Continuously calling and waiting is not feasible for me. Just today, I missed a crucial meeting to stay on the line, and after an hour and twenty minutes, they picked up only to disconnect abruptly. When I called back and endured another hour 's wait, I requested to speak with their manager ( ID : XXXX ) and implored her to expedite the matter, as I need rental coverage while they sort out their procedures that began on XX/XX/XXXX.",

I was fine with that What I did not know was their dishonest ways of adding on 19 % each day my payment was late. This accrued to what became my balloon payment and was only explained to me by XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received the last statement letter that had the amount due of approx. XXXX $ I had no idea that this was protocol nor was it written or verbally explained to me that the additional daily late fees were in effect that resulted in a balloon payment. Throughout the XXXX  year loan my vehicle was repossessed twice and each time I managed to get it back by paying their high fees and towing expenses towing my truck almost XXXX miles from my house and the daily impound fee which added up since I couldn't get to my truck being so far away right away. I paid those fines and got my truck back Currently they repossessed my truck again because of my late payment on the ballon payment that they were demanding. I could only pay about XXXX $ each month to get the remaining amount down. It wasn't enough time. So after XXXX  years, I ended up paying over XXXX $ on a truck that was originally listed for XXXX XXXX Yet I have nothing to show for it now. And a negative mark on my credit report.",

XXXX in returns immediately told me that she could give me XXXX dollars off per week to bring the weekly lease down to XXXX. However, instead of me getting the XXXX discount XXXX in billing continued to charge me the regular price for the vehicle. I called an informed XXXX that she was overcharging me for the vehicle and her answer was XXXX dollars off the total price of the lease. I explained to XXXX that if you subtract XXXX dollars off XXXX it comes out to # XXXX. I called XXXX several times to inform her that I was being overcharged on the lease and she kept saying that those are paid invoices never giving me the proper credit for my payments. Nevertheless, I received a call from XXXX in the billing department asking me to return the lease on XX/XX/XXXX. I decided to email the manager XXXX and inform him that I did not owe Ford XXXX {$690.00}, and that XXXX was not giving me credit for my payments ( Attachment 1 ). \nWhenever I made a payment to Ford XXXX, they would give me a receipt of my payment. I provided the following information to the manager XXXX on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX and he emailed me back and he emailed me back on XX/XX/XXXX, and gave me all of these incorrect figures of what I owed to Ford XXXX ( attachment 2 ). \nI immediately, emailed XXXX back and sent him copies of all my Invoices, Receipts and bank statements to show the exact amount of money that I paid to Ford XXXX.

I emailed XXXX with my invoices, receipts and bank statements which shows my payments, and he email ; following and informed me that I still owed them {$690.00} ( see attachment 3 ) XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX card ending in XXXX matched XXXX XXXX  paid XX/XX/XXXX card ending in XXXX matched XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX card ending in XXXX matched IXXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX  card ending in XXXX not found in our records, not found in the bank statement XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX card ending in XXXX matched XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX carding ending in XXXX matched XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX card ending in XXXX matched XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX card ending in XXXX not found in our records, not found in the bank statement XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX card ending in XXXX matched XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX card ending in XXXX not found in our records, not found in the bank statement Subsequently, XXXX emailed me back again and said, we regret the additional work, but while reviewing the information from our payment processor we found a payment dispute. Could you please take a look at the payment dispute that was made on XX/XX/XXXX for a payment made on XX/XX/XXXX? We do not have information from you about how the dispute occurred. We are interested in hearing your perspective about the reason for it. \nI emailed XXXX and provided him with the additional information and included receipts for XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  and my bank statements for XX/XX/XXXX to show that I paid XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ; however XXXX applied my {$490.00} payment that I made on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX and I have already made the payment on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX Attachment 5 ). Please see the following : XXXX XXXX paid XX/XX/XXXX with Card Ending in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  paid XX/XX/XXXX with Card Ending in XXXX Also, I went into my bank XXXX XXXX and obtained a copy of my bank statement and obtain the bankers card for XXXX to call the bank so they could inform him that on the day that I made the payment to Ford XXXX does not post until the next business day.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX both show the date that I paid which was XX/XX/XXXXXXXX card ending XXXX and the bank statement shows the day the payment posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX both show the day I paid was XX/XX/XXXX, card ending in XXXX and the bank statement shows the payment posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX ( Attachment 4 ). Afterwards on the same day XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX emailed me back and thank me for the additional payment details and information ; but it will take a while, but we want you to know that we received them and we will look into the information ( attachment 6 ) Nevertheless, even though I provided this proof of my payments with receipts and bank statements on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX never emailed me back with the status of my payments, On Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the new invoice for the current week and I was still waiting to hear back from XXXX in reference to the additional information that I provided him ( Attachment 7 ) On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX while I was charging the vehicle a towing company came to repossess the vehicle. I called Ford XXXX and asked to speak to XXXX ; but he refused to get on the phone and just told the representative XXXX to repossess the car. XXXX was wrong and totally unprofessional to not even look into the information that I provided him which shows proof that I dont owe Ford XXXX the XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX are trying to steal the money that I paid to Ford XXXX and this is unfair and shows total dishonesty on behalf of a XXXX Ford Motor company that is under Ford Motor Corporation.",

          "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/2024, I purchased a vehicle from XXXX TX, XXXX. During the transaction, several significant issues arose, leading me to believe the contract was executed under unfair and deceptive practices : Misrepresentation of Payment Terms : The down payment amount was discussed as being between {$2000.00} and {$4000.00} during text message exchanges with the sales representative. However, I was charged {$3000.00} at the point of sale, which was not clearly communicated beforehand. \nThe monthly payment was vaguely described as a \" low {$500.00} payment, '' but the final amount was {$460.00} for 72 months. The exact payment terms were not disclosed until the point of signing. \nFailure to Disclose Finance Charges and Use of High-Pressure Sales Tactics : The interest rate of 24.10 % and a total finance charge of {$15000.00} were not disclosed during the negotiation process. These terms were only revealed at the point of signing, where I was pressured to complete the paperwork quickly. \n\n\nThe documents were signed late in the evening as the dealership was closing. The rapid succession of signatures, combined with the late hour, created a high-pressure environment in which I was not given sufficient time to review the terms thoroughly. \nPre-Population of County Selection : The `` County of Title Issuance '' form was pre-populated with XXXX XXXX without my input. I was not given the opportunity to select the appropriate county for title issuance, which is required by law. \nUnjustifiable Denial of Credit and Predatory Lending Practices : Violation : The high-pressure tactics used to finalize the contract and the lack of transparency about the finance charges and terms may indicate predatory lending practices. \n\nApplicable Law : Texas Predatory Lending Law, Texas Business and Commerce Code 2.302, and the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) require transparency and fairness in all credit transactions. Contracts signed under duress or under deceptive practices are voidable under Texas law. \n\nUndisclosed Additional Charges : Charges for a Service Contract ( {$2200.00} ) and Appearance Protection ( {$640.00} ) were added to the final amount financed without proper disclosure or my explicit consent. \nExcessive and Undisclosed Documentary Fee : A documentary fee of {$150.00} was included in the transaction without clear disclosure. \nDue to these issues, the contract was executed in violation of federal and Texas state laws, including the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act ( DTPA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). I am seeking the rescission of the contract, a refund of my {$3000.00} down payment, and the removal of charges related to the additional products. \n\nThese practices have caused significant distress, and I request prompt resolution to avoid further action. Due to the excessively high interest rate of 24.10 %, I am unable to afford the monthly car payments. This financial burden has also led to my denial of employment opportunities, further exacerbating the situation.",

          "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a payoff. The payoff provided from their website did not ask anything about where the car was being traded, or purchased. A pay off through XX/XX/XXXX was provided in the amount of {$32000.00}.\n\nOn XXXX, Honda/Acura Financial Services received the payoff check in the amount of {$32000.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the dealer we traded the vehicle in to ). This was confimred by the tracking information, as well as confirmed by phone from one of the representatives I spoke with. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I had heard nothing from Honda/Acura Financial Services , so I reached out to them. I was told my payoff was short {$370.00} ( taxes and lease termination fee ). I called and spoke with the dealership, then called back and paid the {$370.00} that day just to get the loan paid off as I didn't want it to negatively impact my credit. The representative could not clearly explain nor tell me where in the contract it stated they could hold a payoff/payment to may account, nor could he explain why I had to pay the lease termination fee per contract. He just kept telling me that was how it worked, but couldn't point me to where it said that. He assured me that in 3 days ( could have been 3-4 or something like that, but I heard 3 for sure ) it would be fully paid off and reflected on my account. \n\nMy account with Honda/Acura Financial Services reflects the XXXX was posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. But the payoff still has yet to be posted and it was received 5 days prior to the additional {$370.00} they demanded I pay. \n\nSince then, I have called them multiple times to inquire about when my loan would be paid off and the loan payoff would be posted. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and the loan payment/payoff still hasn't been posted. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and twice on XX/XX/XXXX. Everyone of the times I have called, I have been told it would be 3 days, or 1-3 days ( on the most recent call ). They have been saying 3 days since XX/XX/XXXX. Each day I have called, I have requested multiple time to speak to a manager, to which I am told they can't transfer me. I have asked to speak to the department who posts the payments, and was told they can't transfer the call and don't even have the ability to transfer calls to anyone. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I spent 53 minutes on the phone, most of it on hold, for the representive to try to figure out where in the contract it stated that they could hold the payment/payoff, and where it stated that I could not trade the vehicle to a dealer outside of Honda/Acura with out paying the lease termination fee. I have leased cars for many years now, and have always traded in the vehicles and never had to deal with anything like this. \n\nAlso, on XX/XX/XXXX, I asked why no one had informed me that the payoff was put on hold and not being posted, he told me that was my problem to figure it out, and they weren't going to notify me. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the dealership contacted Honda/Acura Financial Services , they were told that it would be posted to the account tomorrow ( XX/XX/XXXX ) but would take a few days to reflect to my account and stated Monday was a Holiday, so I needed to call on Tuesday to see if it had been posted. The dealership asked why it had not been applied yet, and was told they had no idea.\n\nI and the dealership should not have to keep calling every day to see if this has posted, to kept being told a few days, 1-3 days, or 3 days. \n\nI get daily calls from Honda/Acura Financial Services , harrassing me to make my payment. This begun on XX/XX/XXXX after I called and I am still receiving this call every day. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, 4 days after they received my payoff, a late fee was accessed to my account. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, a manager from Acura did finally call back, she stated the payoff would be completed today XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her where in the contract it stated about holding payoffs and where it stated I can't trade to another dealer. She said that in the contract it doesn't state they can hold payments/payoffs. As far as the lease termination fee, she said in section XXXX of the contract. When I pushed back and said I didn't end the lease or return the vehicle, it was purchased, she kept telling me that section addressed me not being able to sell/trade to another dealer, when I asked her to show me where, not just tell me I couldn't she could not do that. This was on a call that she did tell me was being recorded. She said if you decide to go through an outside dealer, you are charged more. She kept saying it was in section XXXX, but couldn't tell me where it stated that trading to a dealer/dealer purchasing it I would be charged {$370.00}. She also referenced section XXXX, but it didn't say that either. She said section XXXX, but that is the turn in fee, it wasn't turned in. She again assured me initially that I could see it was paid off today, but then said it would be tomorrow. By end end of the call, she stated it was paid off on their end. She stated there was no overage, even though there was 4 days extra added to the payoff.",

          "complaint_what_happened": "My vehicle was repossessed due to a default in the auto loan with Fulton Bank since XX/XX/XXXX. There has been numerous communications with the lender on options of getting caught up on the loan. The reason for default was due to an unexpected loss of employment since XX/XX/XXXX. Once I gained employment on XX/XX/XXXX, I stuck to my good faith communication of making a payment on my first pay check at XX/XX/XXXX, in which I did for the amount of {$750.00} which should have resolved the payment from XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$40.00} and the XX/XX/XXXX loan amount of {$640.00}. The vehicle was repossessed 6 days later. When I called the lender to inquire on the details of getting the vehicle back into my possession, the authorized representative had advised that the entire balance of the loan ( pay off amount ) needed to be paid, in addition to the repossession fees. I was told that I may be a liability of a future repossession and that was something the bank did not want to deal with. I was also told that I have been late on my loan since XXXX, in which I had disagreed because the loan payments has always been an ACH from my banking account. When I refused to accept their terms, they immediately set the vehicle up for an auction without giving another option or another look into my disputed claims. Furthermore, the towing company that was used to reposses the vehicle is in another state from which I live and I can not retrieve my personal belongings due to the distance and the office hours of the towing company.",
