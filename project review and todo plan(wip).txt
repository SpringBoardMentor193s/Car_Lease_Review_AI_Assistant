Project Brief Review

This project proposes an AI-powered assistant that helps users understand, review, and negotiate car lease or loan contracts. It combines LLM-based contract analysis, vehicle pricing benchmarks, and VIN-based car history lookup into a single mobile-friendly platform.

The core strength of the project lies in:

Automating SLA and clause extraction from complex legal documents.

Providing data-backed transparency (APR, penalties, mileage limits, fair price ranges).

Acting as a negotiation copilot, not just a passive analyzer.

Technically, the project is feasible and well-scoped:

Public contract samples and VIN APIs are available.

LLMs are suitable for structured extraction and conversational negotiation.

A phased milestone plan reduces implementation risk.

Overall, it’s a strong applied AI project with real consumer value and clear extension paths (fintech, auto dealerships, compliance tools).

To-Do List (Actionable)
Phase 1: Foundation

Finalize system architecture (frontend, backend, LLM service).

Set up GitHub repo and basic CI workflow.

Collect and label sample lease/loan contracts.

Define a fixed schema for SLA fields (APR, term, penalties, etc.).

Phase 2: Contract Processing

Implement document upload API.

Integrate OCR (PDF + scanned images).

Store raw text and metadata in database.

Build initial LLM prompt for SLA extraction.

Validate extraction accuracy on multiple contract formats.

Phase 3: Vehicle Intelligence

Integrate NHTSA VIN API.

Fetch vehicle specs, recalls, and manufacturer data.

Design fallback logic for missing VIN details.

Normalize vehicle data for comparison use.

Phase 4: Pricing & Fairness

Integrate or scrape public pricing sources.

Compute fair price ranges by model, year, and location.

Design and implement “Contract Fairness Score” logic.

Flag red-flag clauses automatically.

Phase 5: Negotiation Assistant

Design negotiation prompt templates.

Implement chatbot for dealer conversation guidance.

Add email/message generation feature.

Tie negotiation advice to extracted SLA + market data.

Phase 6: Frontend MVP

Build Flutter app structure (auth, upload, dashboard).

Display contract summaries and risk highlights.

Add VIN report and price comparison views.

Integrate negotiation chatbot UI.

Phase 7: Testing & Demo

End-to-end testing (contract → insight → negotiation).

UI/UX refinement.

Prepare demo video and documentation.

Deploy beta version.
