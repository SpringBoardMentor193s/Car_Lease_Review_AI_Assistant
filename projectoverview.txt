The Car Lease/Loan Contract Review and Negotiation AI Assistant is a 
mobile application created to help users understand car lease and loan
agreements in a simple way. Many car contracts are difficult to read
because they contain legal and financial terms that are confusing for 
common users.

In this project, users can upload their car lease or loan contracts in 
PDF or image format. The system reads the document using OCR and then 
uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract important details such as 
interest rate, lease duration, monthly payment, mileage limits, penalties,
and early termination conditions.

The application also verifies vehicle information using the VIN number by 
accessing public vehicle data sources. This helps users confirm vehicle 
details like manufacturer information and recall history. In addition, 
the app compares the contract price with market price data to check whether 
the deal is fair.

An AI-based negotiation assistant guides users by suggesting negotiation 
points and helping them communicate better with dealers. Overall, the 
application acts as a personal car purchase assistant that helps users 
make informed and confident financial decisions.
