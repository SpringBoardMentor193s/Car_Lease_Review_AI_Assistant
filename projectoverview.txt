The Car Lease/Loan Contract Review and Negotiation AI Assistant is an AI-powered mobile application that helps users understand and evaluate car lease or loan contracts.
The system uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically analyze uploaded contract documents and extract important SLA terms such as interest rate, lease duration,
monthly payment, mileage limits, penalties, and early termination clauses.

Users can upload contracts in PDF or image format, which are processed using OCR and LLM-based document understanding. The extracted information is presented as a 
structured summary along with red flags and a contract fairness score.

The application also performs VIN-based vehicle verification using publicly available APIs to fetch vehicle specifications, manufacturer details, and recall history.
Vehicle pricing is compared with market benchmarks using open vehicle datasets to assess deal fairness.

An AI-powered negotiation assistant helps users identify negotiable terms and generate negotiation messages. The application is developed using Flutter, providing a 
mobile-friendly interface and acting as a personal car purchase assistant to support informed financial decisions.
