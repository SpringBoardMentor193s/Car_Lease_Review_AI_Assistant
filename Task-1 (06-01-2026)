This database schema supports the Car Lease/Loan Contract Review and Negotiation AI Assistant. It organizes data into key areas:
- Users: Store personal details and login information.
- Vehicles: Capture VIN, make, model, year, odometer, and specs.
- Contracts: Central table linking users, vehicles, dealers, and lenders.
- Contract SLA & Clauses: Hold extracted financial terms (APR, payments, mileage, fees) and highlight risky clauses.
- Negotiation: Threads and messages for dealer/lender communication, including AI-generated suggestions.
- Dealers & Lenders: Business and contact details for transparency.
- Vehicle Reports & Recalls: Provide car history, recalls, and safety information.
- Price Recommendations: Store fair price ranges and benchmarks.
- Logs & Audits: Track API integrations and user actions.
- Providers & Credentials: Manage external data sources securely.
How It Works
- A user uploads a contract → SLA terms are extracted → Clauses flagged.
- Vehicle linked via VIN → Recalls and reports fetched → Price recommendations calculated.
- Negotiation assistant helps generate messages → Stored in threads → Offers compared.
