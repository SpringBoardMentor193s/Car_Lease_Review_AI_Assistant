Car Lease/Loan Contract Review and Negotiation AI Assistant

Project Overview

The Car Lease or Loan Contract Review and Negotiation App is an AI-driven application designed to assist consumers in understanding, reviewing, and negotiating car lease or loan contracts. The application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for Service Level Agreement (SLA) extraction and identifies key financial and contractual terms from complex legal documents.
The system aims to improve transparency in automotive financing by simplifying contract language and providing structured insights that help users make informed financial decisions.

Purpose of Data Usage
